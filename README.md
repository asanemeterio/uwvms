Sprint Review and Retrospective 

a. What did you learn from doing our first sprint?
We learned that communication is really important and that it is also important to meet on a more frequent basis. 
b. What did go well? Why?
We were able to delegate tasks well but I think that it can be even further improved on the next sprint.
c. What didn’t go well? Why not?
	We did not start as early as we should have because we had very little momentum from our first meeting. We are still in the process of scheduling meetings around all of our unique schedule constraints, but we are much better off than we were at the beginning of the sprint because we have communicated more since then.
d. How can you make things better next time?
	Next time, we want to meet on a more frequent basis so that we do not lose momentum with the sprint. We also want to better familiarize ourselves with Vue, which is a new app that will help us create an interactive calendar for our home page. 
e. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
	So far we are satisfied with the direction we’re moving in. However, we need to be more productive and continue working on the project to meet project deadlines
f. Feedback received from client if applicable.
Jackie is hoping for the website to have a feature of uploading pictures from the events onto the website for people to view afterwards.


Sprint 1
As a user I need to be able to login and access my account.
Create structure of login page using HTML

As a user I need to be able to view the home page of the volunteer site.

As a user I need to be able to manage and plan out my volunteer events.
Create form to add in availability
Populate calendar with availability
Create form only accessible to admins for posting new events

Create button to sign up for event and form to confirm enrollment


Prioritization
Build navigation bar of homepage
Create header, banner, and containers for the main page
Build calendar view
Create page for users to manage documents/waivers/contracts/forms
Create form to input/track hours volunteered
Create form only accessible to admins for posting new events
Create page to view events
Create button to sign up for event and form to confirm enrollment
Create form to add in availability
Populate calendar with availability
Enable toggling between pages (profile/user portal, volunteer hours, upcoming events, forms, etc)
Create structure of login page using HTML
Enable buttons to log in using JavaScript
Create database using Firebase
Create user portal with relevant account information 
Add contact information to the “Contact Us” tab


The rationale behind this prioritization is that it is most important to build out the structure of the main page, so that the rest of the components can be placed in the right spot as they’re developed. Having a calendar view is a main feature of our proposed system, and is something none of us have had experience with creating before, so getting that to work is a high priority for us. It is also the base for a few of our other features, such as displaying availability, displaying event times, and marking events the user is planning on attending, so the calendar needs to be functional before adding those features. There are multiple forms throughout the site that make the management system unique to each user, so those are the next priority. Also, different pages house different information about the events, the users account, and availability so making those available is imperative for the user experience. Making the different pages and forms clickable is then necessary for the user to navigate between each of those tabs. Creating the login page is still important, but our last priority because it is not essential to the overall functionality of the site. We figured that completing all of the unique features would take the majority of the time, and creating the login is something that we are all familiar with, so we saved that task for last. For the burndown chart, 1 story point represents an estimated 1-2 hours of individual work.
